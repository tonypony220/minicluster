# minicluster
42 project, setup of a Kubernetes cluster. Services include an nginx, an FTPS, a Wordpress and a PHPMyAdmin working with a MySQL database, and a Grafana linked to an InfluxDB database for monitoring. The script builds the custom Docker images for each of those, before deploying and exposing them all with custom yaml files.
